# HGAICS
- This proposed method is to remedy the shortcomings of CS and other Improved CS.
- The results show that the performance of the proposed hybrid algorithm not only determines uncertain parameters of the considered structure properly but also is more accurate than GA, CS and improved CS (ICS)
- HGAICS contains two outstanding characteristics as follows: (1) GA is employed to create original particles with the best quality based on the capacity of crossover and mutation operators and (2) those particles are then applied to look for the global best derived from the flexible and global search ability of ICS
- To run the code: You have to replace my problem to your problem by simply only changing the objective function (CostFunction in the code)
